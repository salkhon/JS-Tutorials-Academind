in js, == and != are for value equaloty or inequality.
So 2 == '2', becuase they have the same value.

Whilst for value and type equality, === !==
In JS you should prefer the === triple equality signs. 
Makes your intentions clear.

Comparing arrays and objects are not like other types.
{name: 'Sal'}, {name: 'Sal'}
These are differently instantiated, but of the same content.
=== or == both with yield false.
 
For objects (arrays are objects) they are compared as reference types, like Java.

All objects and arrays have truthy vals. null undefined NaN have falsy values.
