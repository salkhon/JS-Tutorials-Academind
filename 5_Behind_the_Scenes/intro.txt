ES stands for ECMA Script. Which is the language behind JS. JS is a specific version of ECMA Script. 
ECMA script is under active development. Browser vendors adapt to such development. 

JS Evolution:
ES5 (and older): Standardization.

ES6 (and newer): Modern javascript.

You can create a variable with the var keyword. let is available from ES6.
var allows us to create variables in the function and gloabal scope.
let does not really use function and global scope, but it uses a concept called block scope.
