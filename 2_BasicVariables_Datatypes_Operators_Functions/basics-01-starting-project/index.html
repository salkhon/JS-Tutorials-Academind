		<!-- in order to recognise the html elements in the script they
		have to render the html code. So importing scripts have to be at the bottom.  
		Refer to importing scripts video of Max. 
		Adding scripts at the bottom has performance issues. The script s can't begin executing
		until all of them are downloaded and the html is parsed. The scripts are 
		downloaded at the ending portion of html parsing. So there is a significant delay
		between the html parsing and script execution. This happens because the scripts
		are coded after the html rendering. However, puttong them above will cause undefined referrence errors.
		We can't execute the scripts before the html is parsed. But downloading them before 
		parsing is complete should make the process faster. 
		We want to load the scripts as early as possible and only execute them
		after all html is parsed, to get the best of both worlds. 
		So putting the script tags at the start will start downloading them 
		before html is completely parsed. But 'defer' keyword will prevent executing
		them
		async: executes script right after downloading. Parsing html is suspended until
		executed. This will only work if no html element is refered in the script.
		When scripts don't interact with the webpage, maybe you send data to 
		background server. With async, the script executes as early as possible, 
		as soon as it is downloaded.
		SO, the order of the script execution is not guaranteed. The app.js might be 
		executed before vendor.js if it is loaded earlier. With 'defer' browser gaurantees order. 
		async is solution only if you have a standalone script that does not rely
		on your html content.
		async and defer are only applicable only for external scripts. 
		If inline script is used, no download is necessary. Such scripts are
		always executed immediately. Therefore they need to put at the bottom 
		of the body section. 
		Inline script and imported script cannot be combined.-->
